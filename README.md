### #Resist Events
The code befind the #Resist Events Alexa skill that tells you when and where the nearest/next resistance event is

Many thanks to resistancenearme.org for cataloging all the events around the country.

Currently, this skill is in beta, so you have to email me at aaronbstrauss@gmail.com for an invitation to the skill. If enough people like it, perhaps I'll ask Amazon to certify it (that process takes a while).

If you'd like to learn how to create your own skill with node.js as I did, I recommend diving in [https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/getting-started-guide](here) and [https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-nodejs](here).
